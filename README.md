Friendship Bracelet is a mod to replace /tpa and similar commands on multiplayer servers. Upon creating, a friendship bracelet is bound to the person who crafted it. If the crafting was automated, it can be bound by right-clicking with it in hand. If a friendship bracelet is bound to your UUID, you can equip it to a ring bauble slot. If you give a friendship bracelet to someone, they can hold right-click while holding the bracelet to teleport to you any time you are wearing the bracelet.
